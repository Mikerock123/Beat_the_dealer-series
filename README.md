# Beat_the_dealer-series

This little fun project was originally created for my buddy Jason Yi, after I learned he lost 6 digits once in a casino by playing
Balck Jack against the daeler, and I personally like this guy a lot since he's got an interesting temper I like and he's
leaving China to US very soon. 

However, the reason I'm sharing this project is not only just for fun, also I'd like to encourage whoever wants to accomplish anyting
in your life, trust yourself, instead of hesitating, just do it, you will get something done in the end. For guys has zero programming 
experiences like me, after months of learning in my spare time, I alreay could do something interesting, and I will keep doing it. 

In this series, I will include 2 versions, 1 is for higher chances of fetching higher value cards close or equal to 21 
for players against dealer; 2 is for higher chance the dealer will bust against players. 

This also for anyone who has a long and heavy day, if you would like some outrageous fun against computers, then this is it!
It won't cost you more than 1 minute to recharge yourself, super fast, easy and fun!
