# Beat_the_dealer-series

This little fun project was originally created for my buddy Jason Yi, after I learned he once lost a lot lot of money
(6 digits if I'm not mistaken?) once in a casino in states by playing Balck Jack against the daeler,
and I personally like this guy since he's got an interesting temper and he's leaving China to US very soon. 

However, the reason I'm sharing this project is not only just for fun, also I'd like to encourage whoever wants to accomplish anyting
in your life, trust yourself, instead of hesitating, just do it, you will get something done in the end. For guys has zero programming 
experiences like me, after months of learning in my spare time, I alreay could do something interesting, and I will keep doing it. 

In this series, I will include 2 versions, 1 is for higher chances of fetching higher value cards close or equal to 21 
for players against dealer; 2 is for higher chance the dealer will bust against players. 

So, whether you'd like to have your fun based on your paramount ability against computers(ok, it's cheating, I know), 
or have your fun from the pain you will inflict to the computer, then this might be for you! 

It won't cost you more than 1 minute to recharge yourself, super fast, easy and fun!
